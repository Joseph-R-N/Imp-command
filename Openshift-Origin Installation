How to download OpenShift

First we need to download the latest OpenShift Origin file. As of this writing, that version number is 3.11.0. Go back to the terminal window and issue the command:
  > wget https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases/download/v3.11.0/openshift-origin-client-tools-v3.11.0-0cbc58b-linux-64bit.tar.gz

Once the file is downloaded, extract it with the command:
  > tar xvzf openshift*.tar.gz

Change into the newly-created directory with the command:
  > cd openshift-origin-client-tools*/

Move the kubectl and oc binaries with the command:
  > sudo mv  oc kubectl  /usr/local/bin/

Finally, make sure you can run the oc command with:
  > oc version

The command should report back:
  oc v3.11.0+0cbc58b
  kubernetes v1.11.0+d4cacc0
  features: Basic-Auth GSSAPI Kerberos SPNEGO
  Server https://127.0.0.1:8443
  kubernetes v1.11.0+d4cacc0

You're ready to continue on.
Insecure registry and starting the cluster
Before taking your first steps with OpenShift Origin, you need to configure it such that it can use an insecure registry. To do this, issue the command:
cat << EOF | sudo tee /etc/docker/daemon.json
{
    "insecure-registries" : [ "172.30.0.0/16" ]
}
EOF

Restart Docker with the command:
  > sudo systemctl restart docker

You can now start the server with the command:
  > oc cluster up

After the cluster is up, bring it back down with the command:
  > oc cluster down

Once that command completes, you need to then configure a file so that OC doesn't constantly redirect from your hosting server IP address to 127.0.0.1. 
To do this, open the config file with the command:
  > sudo vi ./openshift.local.clusterup/openshift-controller-manager/openshift-master.kubeconfig

In that file, search for the line:
server: https://127.0.0.1:8443
Replace that line with:
server: https://SERVER_IP:8443
Where SERVER_IP is the IP address of the hosting server.
Save and close the file. Bring the cluster back up with the command:
  > oc cluster up --public-hostname=SERVER_IP
Where SERVER_IP is the IP address of the hosting server.

How to log in 
Let's start with the command line interface for OpenShift Origin. To log on as a standard user, issue the command:
  > oc login -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD
Where USERNAME is a valid username on the server and PASSWORD is the password for said user. 

To log on as the administrator, issue the command:
  > oc login -u system:admin

When you login as the system admin, you will have access to built-in projects, and can easily switch between them (Figure A).
